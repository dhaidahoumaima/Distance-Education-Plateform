# Distance-Education-Platform

The Distance Education Platform is a web application designed to provide online education and learning opportunities to students
from anywhere in the world. It offers a comprehensive set of features and functionalities to facilitate effective teaching and
learning experiences.

## Description

The Distance Education Platform was developed during one of my internships, where I had the opportunity to work on a real-world
project under the guidance of mentors and industry professionals. The platform is built using React.js for the front end, Node.js
and Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB as the database. It enables user authentication, course management, enrollment system,
interactive learning with quizzes and assignments, and progress tracking for students.
